# Background

We all have people that used to be in our lives, but no longer are. This can be due to a plethora of factors. As seniors, we're expecting to face this issue next year as our friend groups splinter and move across the globe. Considering something similar happened after high school, as well as something similar happening to people in the years above us, we decided to try solve this issue.

We did some research and what we noticed is that oftentimes people fail to stay connected simply due to lack of time (or the lack of being able to coordinate time), common circumstances, and grievances with the current social media apps. What we found is that all of the people we talked to would also appreciate lowering barrriers in initiating conversation.

With all of this in mind, we set a goal of helping friend groups remain in touch with each other by helping spark meaningful conversation and connection. We have developed Kaaa, an app where friend groups periodically get thoughtful drawing prompts to help groups feel more connected and spark meaningful conversation amongst each other.
