# Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Explanation
We made our low-fidelity prototype using Figma. The prototype was navagable using inter-frame linking, so when a user clicked a button they were taken to the corresponding page on the web app. We then gave our prototype to participants, and observed them trying to navigate through the app.

## Components
We have several main components in our prototype:
- A login page where users can sign up/login
- A home page
    - Users can select a group
    - Users can navigate to create group page
    - Users ca nnavigate to add friends page
- Add friends page where users ca nadd friends
- Create group page where users can create a group from their friends
- Whiteboard that allows users to draw freely
    - Displays the current prompt (refreshes periodically)
    - Several pen, color, and brush size options
    - A sidebar that lets you navigate to home or other groups
- Mosaic that allows users to see the current drawing for the selected group
- Gallery that shows the history of all mosaics for the selected group

## Testing Feedback
We carried out Wizard of Oz testing with two goals:
- Test social experience of users
    - How often did they want prompts?
    - Should users be able to see each other's drawing in real time?
- Usability of the app
    - Can users easily navigate through the different pages?
    - Does the layout make sense intuitively?
We gave our prototype to a group of classmates, and as they were navigating through the app we made sure to observe the actions that they took, the things they struggled with, the questions that they had, and the overall interest and viability of the product.

The main things we wanted to learn during this “Wizard of Oz” session were whether button placements made sense, and whether users could reasonably navigate through the app without having to ask us for help. We were also looking to learn whether people preferred one prompt per person per day or one prompt per group per day.

After the Wizard of Oz section, we believe our project to be promising enough to move forward in its development. The feedback we received from other classmates was positive and reinforced our original plans. One key takeaway is that a few individuals commented that they would use the application as a means of connecting with others, reassuring us of the idea for the product. Another key key learning that we had was people wanted options for the level of synchronousness. For example, the individuals we talked to mentioned how they would like to both have an option to be able to draw on a shared canvas with their friends as well as to be able to draw separately, depending on the settings for each group. The main idea behind this is that people like the idea of being able to see changes live, but may sometimes want to turn it off to reduce FOMO or discouragement. Another thing that we learned was that a daily prompt could get tiring, especially if they are in a lot of groups. The changes we plan to implement based on the feedback include a web and mobile application, not having a prompt every day for each group, providing the group with a timing mechanism to decide how often they get drawing prompts, and providing a way to toggle between the level of synchronous-ness.

## Going Forward
We will keep the bulk of the elements in our low-fidelity prototype. We plan to keep all of the same links between the different pages as well as the elements provided on each page. We will expand the next iteration to include a view of a mobile application based on feedback that is fully fledged. For the time being, we won't implement real-time view of other users' drawings, but leave it as a stretch goal, since there was interest.

One thing that we need to change is what happens when you click on a friend. Right now, they aren’t even meant to be buttons, but they look like buttons which is confusing for the user. We also need to add a page to remove a friend and edit that friend's information, so it makes sense to let the button click on the friend list take you to this screen. We also got feedback that we need to avoid making the app a chore. Based on this we could revise our idea so that instead of each group getting a new prompt each day, they are allowed to set the time interval to whatever they want. This way they could get new prompts ranging from every day to once a week.
